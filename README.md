# Backend Of Pseudomonas AeruginoSite 

This bioinformatics development project provides a platform for mining defense systems of the bacteria Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, via a user-friendly web application. Due to the vast amount of information that exists, lack of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa-specialized interface, and no tools to research defense systems and phenotypic or genomic correlation - the need for a cross-referenced information platform arose.
This project revolves around defense systems of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and provides information regarding ~18 different defense systems in ~6000 strains, each of their ~6000 genes, and ~50,000 gene clusters of the bacteria. The project would enable researchers to explore defense systems of bacterial species and to better understand their association with genomic, environmental, and phenotypic traits.
The application provides a variety of displays and visualization tools that helps researchers to get insights by a few clicks, among them:
1.	Interactive tabular display of genes of the desired strains. 
2.	Interactive Circos Genome Browser of a desired strain genome and information about the genes associated with specific defense systems.
3.	Circular Phylogenetic Tree with the distribution of desired associated data (i.e. defense systems, meta-data and more).
4.	Correlation tests between any pair from of the following groups: defense systems, cluster, strain and genes attributes (i.e. genome size and more) and meta-data.
5.	Download any data from the systemâ€™s database for personal use.
The goal of this project is to supply researchers and the scientific community with a web interface to consume, map, and visualize the rather complex information on Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.
